            "Review: It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\n",

            "Review: This movie is many things. One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\n",

My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.\n",

The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\n",

But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\n",

My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.\n",

I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy.

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\n",

The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 20}, page_content=': 20\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: Genti25\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: You are Kenough\\nReview: This movie is so much fun.

Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan.

The way it handles its feminist message is not the best, because while it tries to give a meaningful speach, it almost boarders with hate speach and ridiculization, I say almost, because a lot of this situations are just played by the laughs and when theyre not, while being bad, theyre not terrible. But this makes it sound like a bad movie, which barbie is not, at the end it manages to actually give a meaningfull speech about the wrong in the real world and takes some minutes to understand both sides. It is still not the best ending possible because it can be a little too ridiculous, when you have a movie thats like that all the time I dont think it matters all that much. And at the end of the day I took home with me the minutes of laughter this movie gave to me, an enjoying fun time that is worth watching.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv')]\n",

What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\n",

            "Review: Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

            "Review: Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\n",

            "Review: Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain\n",

Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture.

Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\n",

World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.\n",

The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 136}, page_content=': 136\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: rayanenaffati\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.\\nReview: \"Oppenheimer\" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer\\'s perspective.

It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused.

The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie.

From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 7}, page_content=': 7\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: portraitofaladyonfire\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Brilliant observations, but social depth is missing\\nReview: Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have a knack for incorporating the many little observations of life, whether funny or deeply interpersonal, into a screenplay.

While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames.

He brings to light the historical significance of the Manhattan project and Los Alamos through the scientific and political background of such a unique town portrayed with perfection by such actors as Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon. By using Los Alamos and New Mexico as a film location for the film, Nolan is able to portray what life would have been for Oppenheimer and other scientists with their families around the time of the Trinity test.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9200288/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 58}, page_content=\": 58\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: show24studio\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: A brilliant masterpiece that cuts to the core of human fear\\nReview: Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture.

Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9233822/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 18}, page_content=\": 18\\nReview_Date: 4 August 2023\\nAuthor: thePopcornExplorer\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: I don't see how it was preachy\\nReview: In this day and age with society overall becoming more and more polarized and our leaders around the world doing nothing to improve dialogue, it seems that people became broken records.

As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9207372/?ref_=tt_urv\")]\n",

The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\n",

But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?\n",

It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed.

The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none.

Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9210020/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 15}, page_content=\": 15\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: Revuer223\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.\\nReview: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while.

One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 43}, page_content=\": 43\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: brianjohnson-20043\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: This movie tries to be too much\\nReview: I wanted to like it.

At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead.

It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\n",

            "Review: I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.\n",

I left the theatre in such a good mood. It was the sense of humor for me, laughed so hard. Specially Ryan Gossling was sooooo good and funny, many familiar faces to spot also. And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there.

My favourite scene of the movie is just rather a small quiet moment where Barbie is observing every day life and tells an old woman how beautiful she is. Margot Robbie shines in the lead role. Ryan Gosling clearly was having a lot of fun with the role, but don't sleep on Michael Cera as Allan. I know a lot of people say that Ryan Gosling is a scene stealer, but personally I thought Michael was.\n",

They praised his versatility, comedic timing, and ability to steal the scenes he was in. Some even mentioned that he was a scene-stealer, and that he was the highlight of the movie. Only a few reviewers had mixed feelings or were neutral about his performance.\n",

            "Review: Having seen this movie twice now, I've laughed, I've cried and I enjoyed every minute of this movie! When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was thinking there is no way this movie will be any good! Well I am happy to say that I am wrong because I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Margot Robbie was great as Barbie while Ryan Gosling was great as Ken! It also stars America Ferreira, Will Farrell and other A-List actors! It definitely has a great story line to it and the soundtrack was also amazing! For those who are skeptical about the movie, DON'T BE! I highly recommend it.\n",

Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.\n",

            "Review: This movie is specially for those who loves the character of barbie specially in childhood. This film is a treat for Barbie lovers because the way director has told the storyline by introducing a whole barbie world and their characters is interesting to watch. Specially MARGOT ROBBIE what and actress she is her looks, style, acting performances, dresses of barbie all are top notch. Margot Robbie is perfectly suited for this role because she is the only one carrying the whole movie throughout the end. From start to end the main highlight of the this film is Margot Robbie. I've only watched this film for her and she has proved that currently she is one of the best actress in Hollywood. When I talk about supporting cast RYAN GOSLING is the only one who has done justice to the character of Ken rest are just average. Story is the main disappointment of the film, Film starts on a good note with laughs and riot of chaos when Barbie enters into the real world but after a bit of time story get exaggerated and only focuses on the central character which is the drawback of the film and from that case movie doesn't get the chance to give space to the other important characters. Background score and songs are good that wil give you a fresh vibe while watching this film. All n all this movie is a treat for Barbie fans and rest of the audience may consider as an average content....\n",

Some critics find him to be the standout element of the film, while others mention that he adds depth to the character of Ken. However, there are a few mixed reviews, with some viewers finding his portrayal to be over the top or distracting from the overall narrative.\n",

I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 114}, page_content=\": 114\\nReview_Date: 7 August 2023\\nAuthor: christopherbrooke\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Amazing movie (watched it twice now)\\nReview: Having seen this movie twice now, I've laughed, I've cried and I enjoyed every minute of this movie!

            "Review: Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.\n",

            "Review: I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\n",

            "Review: Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.\n",

            "Review: I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\n",

I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors.

The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\n",

            "Review: Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\n",

Hyperbole aside, we're only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that's very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn't fully convinced of Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) 'near zero' proclamation that all would be well.\n",

            "Review: Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\n",

Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.\n",

            "Helpful Answer: Yes, the movie \"Barbie\" explores themes of existentialism, as it deals with the main character's internal struggles and self-discovery, questioning her identity and purpose. While it doesn't explicitly use the term \"existentialism,\" the movie shares similar themes with works that fall under this philosophical category. For example, the movie's colorful and whimsical setting, along with its exploration of human emotions and the meaning of life, aligns with existentialist ideas. However, it is not mentioned in any of the reviews provided that the other movies explored themes of existentialism.\n",

The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9233822/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 41}, page_content=': 41\\nReview_Date: 28 July 2023\\nAuthor: classicsoncall\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: \"But I can run the Manhattan Project.\"\\nReview: Filmmaker Paul Schreder has called \"Oppenheimer\" the \"best, most important film of this century\". Hyperbole aside, we\\'re only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that\\'s very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer\\'s (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn\\'t fully convinced of Edward Teller\\'s (Benny Safdie) \\'near zero\\' proclamation that all would be well.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9220766/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 139}, page_content=': 139\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: andysaleen-05305\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.\\nReview: Oppenheimer was just okay-good.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 108}, page_content=\": 108\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: tyler200\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Too long and too little to draw interest.\\nReview: An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9214879/?ref_=tt_urv\")]\n",

            "Review: The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\n",

However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 35}, page_content=': 35\\nReview_Date: 4 August 2023\\nAuthor: evanston_dad\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Smart and Winning\\nReview: My wife and I were two of the apparently 200,000 or so people who Barbenheimered Greta Gerwig\\'s and Chritopher Nolan\\'s hot topic movies on opening weekend. \"Oppenheimer\" was first, a boring slog of history in which a bunch of white men blathering at each other for three hours resulted in the creation of weapons that could wipe out humanity. \"Barbie\" came in the evening, a fresh breeze of humanity to clear away Nolan\\'s emotional constipation.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 139}, page_content=': 139\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: andysaleen-05305\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.\\nReview: Oppenheimer was just okay-good.

Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it.

It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\n",

            "Review: I can't help but wonder what this movie would've looked like if it had been directed by a different filmmaker, and I believe that it probably would've been better. Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\n",

Hyperbole aside, we're only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that's very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn't fully convinced of Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) 'near zero' proclamation that all would be well.\n",

            "Review: Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\n",

The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself.

On the other hand, the movie \"Oppenheimer\" doesn't seem to explicitly explore themes of existentialism as it primarily focuses on the personal and professional life of Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. However, the movie could be interpreted as having elements related to existentialism since Oppenheimer grapples with the moral implications of creating such a destructive weapon.\n",

What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 136}, page_content=': 136\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: rayanenaffati\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.\\nReview: \"Oppenheimer\" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer\\'s perspective.

Now everything in the movies and TV shows is perceived as preachy, not everything is a conspiracy, people need to consider that movies and TV shows at its core, and specially the good ones, are about sharing perspectives and allow the audience, if their minds are opened to it, to acknowledge all sides of the stories.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 70}, page_content=\": 70\\nReview_Date: 7 August 2023\\nAuthor: misscattik\\nRating: \\nReview_Title: No questions just answers\\nReview: The title of the review practically sums it all up. With the highest potential in style, aesthetics, cast and concept, the movie fails spectacularly when it comes to the deliverance of it's main idea. And it's not feminism that bothers, surely not, it's the artistic language in which the idea is told - harsh, manipulative, abusive, straightforward and unkind. Instead of aspiring the audience to think and reflect, it shoves the manifestations down your throat, and in monologues that are generally painfully awkward to watch.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 75}, page_content=\": 75\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: siddharth-61578\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Movie which was not required\\nReview: The movie is well directed but somehow the topic seems completely irrelevant. Robert Oppenheimer no doubt did a miracle (biggest curse on mankind, actually) by inventing atomic bomb but do we really require movie on legal events unfolding after the bombing event. Don't think these legal tangles and all are so important in course of history that movie is made out of it. The movies is unnecessarily 3 hours long and sometimes it feels that there is no point in knowing so insignificant events which happened post bombing event. Rather more focus on bomb invention and events leading bomb invention would have been an interesting event.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9209007/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 43}, page_content=\": 43\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: brianjohnson-20043\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: This movie tries to be too much\\nReview: I wanted to like it.

It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I\\'m a crotchety old man, I\\'m a woman in my 20s, so I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m this movie\\'s target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid\\'s movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the \"strong\" woman.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 27}, page_content=': 27\\nReview_Date: 19 July 2023\\nAuthor: bissatadam\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: Simply amazing\\nReview: This movie is very interesting and very thrilling. Since this movie had no action and was mostly just a documentary and was 3 hours long, I though that it was going to be boring. But, the 3 hours went by very fast and had me at the edge of my seat the whole time. This movie is like no other movie I had ever seen it is very unique and mind blowing. The cinematography is beautiful and the aesthetic of the movie is also beautiful. Anyone who is interested in the history of war and bombs would love this movie but I think anyone would enjoy this movie.

It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9202920/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 133}, page_content=': 133\\nReview_Date: 29 July 2023\\nAuthor: jack_o_hasanov_imdb\\nRating: 8\\nReview_Title: Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds\\nReview: This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer\\'s point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom.

Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9233822/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 41}, page_content=': 41\\nReview_Date: 28 July 2023\\nAuthor: classicsoncall\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: \"But I can run the Manhattan Project.\"\\nReview: Filmmaker Paul Schreder has called \"Oppenheimer\" the \"best, most important film of this century\". Hyperbole aside, we\\'re only twenty-two plus years into the century, and not many of us will be around to confirm his hypothesis. So best? Well, that\\'s very subjective. Important though, he might be onto something. Important in the way the latter part of the picture emphasizes Robert J. Oppenheimer\\'s (Cillian Murphy) personal angst in leading a team that developed the capability of destroying the entire world and all of mankind. That could have occurred on July 16, 1945 with the testing of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, even Oppenheimer wasn\\'t fully convinced of Edward Teller\\'s (Benny Safdie) \\'near zero\\' proclamation that all would be well.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9220766/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 139}, page_content=': 139\\nReview_Date: 21 July 2023\\nAuthor: andysaleen-05305\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: Sometimes a movie tries to mention everything and ends up saying nothing.\\nReview: Oppenheimer was just okay-good.

The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. \"Barbie\" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the \"corporate\" issue. It won\\'t be strange if you catch yourself thinking \"how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?\" Laughing at yourself, after all, seems to be a prerequisite for establishing communication with a young generation of consumers who associate their consumption habits with a critical eye on consumerism itself.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 108}, page_content=\": 108\\nReview_Date: 25 July 2023\\nAuthor: tyler200\\nRating: 5\\nReview_Title: Too long and too little to draw interest.\\nReview: An interesting man to create a movie about and Cillian Murphy did great job portraying him, but obviously the main appeal of the story is how he created the atomic bomb. Did they show what went into that project? Sure, but it wasn't the main focus. The majority of the movie was much more about Oppenheimer's personal life, including his political views and relationship issues. I also didn't care for the way it kept jumping around in time, sort of like the recent Elvis movie. This creates a sense that you're watching a trailer for a movie, instead of a movie itself. If it was half as long and was more about the bomb, I would have rated it much higher.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9214879/?ref_=tt_urv\")]\n",

I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.\n",

The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors.

He loved every bit of it and was totally focused. Once it was over, he walked out with a sense of satisfaction. [Review by Achyut_Prashast_Singh]\n",

I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too.

The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9205774/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 10}, page_content=\": 10\\nReview_Date: 20 July 2023\\nAuthor: Zay-Fee\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: Exceptional storytelling and Genius Cinametography\\nReview: Just came out of the theater and watching Oppenheimer was such a great experience. I know many people will criticize the movie for some historical accuracy absence but I think Christopher Nolan has made this complicated man's story compelling, engaging, and simple to understand. The actors are phenomenal. Apart from the main leads, Robert Downey has probably done one of his finest work. His expressions, timing, delivery... Everything was on par. The cinematography has been crafted beautifully. I adored and enjoyed the whole three hours with ease and delight. This is the first attempt of Christopher Nolan at biographies and I think we should expect more of his work from this genre since it's not only entertaining but also sparks an interest to know history more. I have read the book earlier so I went to watch it with a little bit of knowledge and still enjoyed the film. I wish I could tell Cillian Murphy in person how stunning his screen presence has been throughout. Hopefully, this movie wins the awards like it deserves.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9202236/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 141}, page_content=': 141\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: eddie_baggins\\nRating: 10\\nReview_Title: You\\'ve never seen a film like Oppenheimer\\nReview: It\\'s taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about Christoper Nolan\\'s newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous \"Barbenheimer\" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate I am confident in saying that I\\'ve never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it\\'s a film with flaws and components that don\\'t stick their respective landings, Nolan\\'s film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9210969/?ref_=tt_urv'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 28}, page_content=': 28\\nReview_Date: 16 August 2023\\nAuthor: TheOny13\\nRating: 9\\nReview_Title: No CGI here, just good writing and very good acting\\nReview: Oppenheimer was the most anticipated movie of the year for me.

Like most Nolan films this lacks emotion. Oppenheimer was a stoic man for sure but he had moments of catharsis throughout his life. Having read the book this film is based on (American Prometheus) I noticed that many of the relationships that affected his (Oppie's) life and career, and his hypnotic charisma were sadly missing in this film. The whole idea of the book, more over the whole point of Oppie's infamous testimony, was to explain the actions by shedding light on the man. I'm disappointed to say that this is no tale of the man, rather a tale of the Los Alamos project and a couple of testimonies. The film may have been packed with beautiful imagery, riveting score and decent performances, but it's painfully obvious that it lacks heart.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9233822/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 22}, page_content=': 22\\nReview_Date: 22 July 2023\\nAuthor: JustStone\\nRating: 7\\nReview_Title: I Wish I Could Say I Had A Blast\\nReview: I think I will be in the minority here when I say, I think Christopher Nolan missed the mark with this film.

I watched it in IMAX 70mm, the crispness of detail in the 70mm film stock was superb, and the 5.1 DTS-HD master audio surround sound was impactful, sometimes even shaking the seats. The acting was outstanding and there are some really memorable moments and tense scenes between actors.

It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none.

The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\n",

I couldn't stand it. Barbie's world and attitude was a constant bummer. Ken's attitude was sour. For the next hour (and more) the movie just lived in negativity.\n",

            "Review: I knew this was going to be political going in but I thought its Barbie so I could overlook it. But it was too much, I do not enjoy politics in movies, whether it's left or right. I expected it to be more fun, and feel good, and it was for some parts but not enough at all. Ryan was great and so was Margot but I did not understand why Barbie didn't like Ken, it's wildly known that Barbie loves Ken and Ken loves Barbie, it's iconic and it made no sense for everything else in Barbie land to be accurate but not that. Another problem was the writing it was very \"told and not shown\" as well as wordy. The scenery was great as well as the costumes, but the story could have been so much better. Like Barbie and Ken take L. A. on a fun adventure and some self-discovery but it wasn't really like that. The ending was confusing does Barbie want to have a baby?\n",

However, some reviewers did appreciate certain aspects like the costumes, sets, and performances of actors like Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie.\n",

It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as \"stupid\". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed.

The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/oppenheimer.csv', 'row': 105}, page_content=\": 105\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: IamROCKAS\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: It's okay but I'll be the bad guy that will reject this as a masterpiece most people claim it to be\\nReview: Like many this weekend, I spend it in a pact theatre watching one of the most hyped-up movies this summer. Unfortunately for me, not only was the theatre packed but the air-conditioning was out of order too, so it got warm and humid in there quick. If it weren't for this, I could tell whether some of the people in the audience left the movie because they weren't interested (in particular - there were a pair of girls next to me whom kept checking their phones - I counted six instances before they left around the time Jean Tatlock died. I didn't check the time so I can't tell how far into the movie that was) or due to the heat in the theater.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9210020/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 15}, page_content=\": 15\\nReview_Date: 23 July 2023\\nAuthor: Revuer223\\nRating: 6\\nReview_Title: Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.\\nReview: The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while.

One may say it is a story of strength, and finding the beauty in yourself. Others, may just not like it. I am in the middle of all of that. The movie was a little better than meh, but lacked in some aspects that it could have dealt with more. I think Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were good, but I really didn't like their characters (Mostly Ken) The musical numbers and camera work were amazing. But, by far three things stood out to me. One, the costumes design and sets. The directors sculpted amazing set design with colorful costumes to go along with it. My honorable mention is Rhea Perlman. I thought she was phenomenal. While anyone could play that role she really brought it. Finally, America Ferrara. Since her days on Ugly Betty, she has became a household name. But in this movie she was wonderful. I enjoyed Superstore quite a bit and wanted to see Barbie mainly for her character. Her speech was moving and she brought so much to her simple, yet relatable mom.\\nReview_Url: /review/rw9199947/?ref_=tt_urv\"), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/barbie.csv', 'row': 43}, page_content=\": 43\\nReview_Date: 24 July 2023\\nAuthor: brianjohnson-20043\\nRating: 4\\nReview_Title: This movie tries to be too much\\nReview: I wanted to like it.
